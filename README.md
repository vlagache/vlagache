## Hi there, i'm Vincent 👋

### About Me 👨‍💻

In 2018, I knew nothing about computer development. I'd been thinking about learning how to develop for years, and regularly I'd open the same Java tutorial on a well-known French website without really getting serious about it. I was in a period of my life when I wanted to change profession, and I embarked on [a training course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/48-developpeur-web-junior) to learn web development

During this training course, we had to submit several projects and defend them in front of a jury :

- [Project 1 : WebAgency](https://github.com/vlagache/Project-1-OC-WebAgency) - _2018_
- Project 2 : A Wordpress website for a tourist office. The site no longer exists, it's such a shame... 😏
- [Project 3 : DublinBikes](https://github.com/vlagache/Project-3-OC-Javascript) - _2019_
- [Project 4 : Blog for a writer](https://github.com/vlagache/Project-4-OC-BlogPhP) - _2019_
- Final Project : GeoLoc [backend](https://github.com/vlagache/GeoLocServer) & [frontend](https://github.com/vlagache/GeoLocApp) - _2019_

Passion was born 🔥

After validating all the projects in mid-2019, I didn't really feel legitimate enough to face the world of work and make a living from IT development, so I continued to do another thing that I really enjoy in life : learning.

I interviewed for [a Data and AI training course 🤖](https://simplon.co/formation/ecole-ia-microsoft/23) and was accepted. It lasted a year and a half, with a sandwich course at a company in my town. There was also a project to support at the end, which I called [Cycling Travel Time](https://github.com/vlagache/cycling_travel_time/) (_2021_).

In 2021, I was hired and have been making a living from IT development 💻 ever since.

In 2024, in order to delve deeper into some of my personal experiments, I decided to write articles ✍️ about them.
